### Create A Simple Search Engine Using Python
Utilize TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity to retrieve similar articles with query
Information Retrieval right now is an important task. Probably you're wondering, how does the system can retrieve articles that we want using a query? Here are the steps,

Extract documents from the Internet (It could be Web Scraping or extract manually)
Clean the documents to make the retrieval much easier
Create a Term-Document Matrix with TF-IDF weighting
Write your queries and convert it as vector (based on TF-IDF)
Calculate the cosine similarity between the query and the document and repeat the process on each document.
Finally, show the document
